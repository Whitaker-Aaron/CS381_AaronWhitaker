1. To fetch the git submodule, run the linux command: git submodule add https://github.com/Whitaker-Aaron/CS381_AaronWhitaker/tree/main/as0

2. To compile the code, empty out the build folder:

- rm -rf build

    if it is not empty already. Then run the cmake command: 

    - cmake ..

   after the cmake command is run, the only command left to run is the make command: 

- make

3. If the code compiled properly, then run 

- ./as0

    to run the executable, and the small animation should play in the window.
   Since there are no controls for the assignment, these are not applicable.
